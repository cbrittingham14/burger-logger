# burger-logger

This app allows users to view burgers in a database.

The view will display the burger's name, and will align burgers that have
not been devoured on the left side of the page, while those that have been devoured will be 
on the right side of the page.

Undevoured burgers will have a devour button next to them that, when clicked, will move the burger
to the right side of the page.

Users can add new burgers to the database by entering text in the text box.

## Future development

Adding more .css to the view could improve user experience.
